# Cook With Me (My very First Project)
The Idea came into my mind as I Enjoy cooking and Enjoy browsing cooking website, As it is my first project , I used simple design to be easy to read and browse.
It gives the broweser an idea of what is this school for , what type of cooking classes it provides and the way how to contact or reach it.
